# Puppet Basics

This is a very basic introduction to [puppet](https://puppet.com) as it is used in DARIAH-DE.
This course serves as a rough guides first overview to Puppet, in particular version 4.

Note that as of November 2016, DARIAH-DE has not yet switched from Puppet 3 to Puppet 4.

### Prerequesites

You need [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
It is highly recommended that you install the [vagrant-cachier](http://fgrehm.viewdocs.io/vagrant-cachier/) plugin.
Depending on your editor of choice you might want to look into syntax highlighting, e.g. for [Vim](https://github.com/voxpupuli/vim-puppet) or [Atom](https://github.com/atom/language-puppet).
